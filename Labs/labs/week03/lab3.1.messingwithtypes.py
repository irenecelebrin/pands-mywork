answer = 12 
answer_of_question = 24 
AnswerOfQuestion = 6 
#print(f'answer is {answer}')


# advice: use proper names for vriables so it's easy to understand what it does 
# pick a convetion and use that (_ or capital)
# variables need to have letters, you can't use a number to name a variable


print(f'answer is {answer_of_question}')

#type of a variable 

print(f'type of answer is {type(answer_of_question)}')
print(f'type of type is {type(type(answer_of_question))}')
