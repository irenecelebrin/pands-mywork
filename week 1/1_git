1. clone with https to clone on your machine but you cannot modify it 

2. ssh to clone on your machine and be able to push and pull 

1. 
git clone: to clone a repo and make a copy on your machine 

git pull to pull any change -- you can do it after git clone 

git config configure git 

if you modify the repo on your machine, you won't be able to pull any new changes, you need to delete the repo and clone again. 


2. with https you can also push and pull in theory, but every time you need to enter username and pw. if you use a SHH, you can skip those steps 


git add to add code to your local repo 
git commit -rn 'message'
git push to push to could github 

create you ssh key 
go to your ownn directory users\irene

then you create the repo on github. copy ssh and use that to clone on your machine 


git clone *ssh address*
git config pull.rebase false


add a change 
git add
git commit -m 'your message'
git push 

if you refresh you can see the file on github
